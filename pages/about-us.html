            <p>I'm so happy you stopped by! It seems like dropping in for a visit has gone out of style.</p>
            <p>I have been a Jesus believer all my life. I have been a wife since 1981, a mother since 1983, and a grandmother since 2008. I have three children, ten grandchildren, and more than the usual complement of parents and siblings. I was a homeschool mom, and a teacher at a classical Christian school. Currently, I am a language arts tutor and a homeschool mentor.</p>
            <p>Books have always been important to me. I have read many thousands of books in my lifetime, and sometimes, for a minute or two, I can feel overwhelmed by the thought that, with millions of books published each year, it would be impossible for me to read all the books. But then I remember, most of them aren't worthy of my time. One of our goals at Plumfield and Paideia is to help you sort the literary gems from the publishing slash pile.</p>
            <p><em><a href="https://www.prairieprimer.com/product-page/further-up-and-further-in" target="_blank">Further Up and Further In</a></em> is my literature unit study for homeschooling.</p>
